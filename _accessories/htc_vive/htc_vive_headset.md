### Description

The head mounted display for the HTC vive sports lenses that focuses on 2 hi-res screens that display the stereoscopic left and right eye images of a VR scene. Each screen is built to refresh at very high frame rates to produce a realistic view of this computer generated environment. There are limits to this refresh rate: how fast you are moving; how many pixels are on the screen; the robustness of your PC in terms of graphic processin power and memory. 

The exterior of the device is covered in photosensitive sensors that aid in tracking. It also has a camera, to view the world outside of the headset, and a microphone to communicate or record your voice. There is a turning knob on the right side that adjusts the distance between the Left and Right eyes.

### Troubleshooting

If there is still any discomfort, the inter-ocular pupil distance (IPD) knob located on the side of the headset changes the distance between the left and right eye to a position that best suits you. Turn the knob until your view is comfortable and note the number. Save it somewhere to dial in next time.
