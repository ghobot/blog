### Description

Our custom VR rig is a Windows 10 Pro desktop with a discrete Nvidia 1080 GPU and an Intel i7 processor. It connects to the HTC link box, a 4k Monitor, a projector, a secondary 3D-enabled monitor, and other peripherals like keyboards, a mouse, speakers, wifi adapter, and a leap motion hand tracking device. 

If the computer does not wake when you use the keyboard or mouse,  press the black power button at the top of the computer. 

### How to use

Wake the computer by clicking on either keyboard or moving the black mouse. Sign in.
