### Description

[The Asus Zephyrus GX501](https://www.asus.com/us/Laptops/ROG-ZEPHYRUS-GX501/) is our portable solution for the Oculus rift. It is the first of its kind in a gaming laptop by featuring a full-sized but downclocked nvidia 1080 graphics card, giving it more than enough power to run the oculus rift. The design allows for quiet operation as well. It is running windows 10 Professional. 

### How to use

This can be used with the oculus headset, one sensor, and both touch controllers.
