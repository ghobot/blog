### Description

Input devices for your VR experience that are covered in photosensitive sensors that affords the 6 degree tracking. They are wireless so they need to be charged via AA battery. They have several buttons: a menu button, oculus menu button, analog stick, a trigger button for the index finger,  “grip” buttons, and secondary game controller buttons (A,B,X,Y). The button are also capacitive sensitive, and can tell what position your fingers are resting on them. This allows these controllers to monitor what each finger is doing, bringing a higher level of realism to the experience.
