One of a few VR headsets from the [Windows Mixed reality](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-mixed-reality) line. These headsets use inside out tracking technology to create 6 degrees of freedom without the use of external cameras or lighthouses like some competitors.

##### Why this device?
WMR is fully supported by windows 10 and so the experience is stable and runs on a variety of windows machines. It also can access the Steam Store which unlocks a large array of VR experiences. Added to their room scale tracking support, they tend to be lower in price (build quality) even though they have tracked controllers. They are a great plug and play solution for desktop or mobile VR with a laptop. They also flip up making them convenient to use with a desktop.
