Chromecasts are small dongles that enable users with a mobile device or personal computer to start and control playback of internet audio and video to a stereo or tv. (Wikipedia)

##### Why this device?
The chromecast platform allows us to take media on the internet and stream it visual devices like a projector or screen. All of this can be controlled from your phone. It makes it efficient because the device connects to the internet and not your phone for the content. That allows you to free up your phone or tablet for other things. We can also "cast" a chrome web browser tab to a chromecast.
