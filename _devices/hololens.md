Microsoft HoloLens is a pair of mixed reality smartglasses developed and manufactured by Microsoft that runs Windows Mixed Reality platform under the Windows 10 operating system. The HoloLens can trace its lineage to Kinect, another Microsoft device that senses depth. (Wikipedia)

##### Why this device?
This first generation device by Microsoft is one of the best cases thus far for the future of Augmented Reality, where data is superimposed over our view of the world. It features: the ability to map surfaces like walls, floor, and table tops; a voice assistant to trigger actions; recognition of hand gestures for input; a  developer platform. This device poses the question "What if your computer desktop was not just your monitor but the entire space around you?".
