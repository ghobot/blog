HTC Vive is a high-end virtual reality headset developed by HTC and Valve Corporation. The headset is designed to utilize "room scale" technology to turn a room into 3D space via sensors, with the virtual world allowing the user to navigate naturally, with the ability to walk around and use motion tracked handheld controllers to vividly manipulate objects, interact with precision, communicate and experience immersive environments.

##### Why this device?

The HTC Vive is currently at the top of the tech heap when it pertains to jaw-dropping Virtual Reality. Just a few highlights: it supports hand controller inputs; a user has the ability to walk around a space in VR (6 degrees of freedom); you can record your performance; it produces high quality, high fidelity graphics for immersive realism. We are excited that it also supports WebVR, or Virtual Reality on the web, making it possible to more easily develop experiences for situations like the Anatomy Lab.
