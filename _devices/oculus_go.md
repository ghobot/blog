 Oculus developed Oculus Go in partnership with Qualcomm, a large US mobile SoC designer, and Xiaomi, China's largest smartphone maker.[47] Like the Samsung Gear VR and Google's Daydream, the device is not tethered to a computer and it does not require a gaming system to work. It only consists of a headset but the device is not powered by a smartphone. It only has 3 Degrees of freedom tracking. (Wikipedia)

##### Why this device?
This is one of the first standalone, *affordable* VR headsets made for a mass audience. It has intuitive controls and interface. Although it lacks both tracked controllers (hands) and 6 degrees of freedom, the screen is high resolution, with above average lenses. It makes for a comfortable viewing experience for anything optimized for the platform. It also works well with webVR content.
