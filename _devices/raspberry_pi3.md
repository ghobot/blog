The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. The affordable cost, control and long set of features make it a great platform to teach computing. (Wikipedia)

##### Why this device?
Don't be fooled by the Raspberry Pi's small size; it is a full fledged computer. We use it to prototype applications and sensors. Its size also makes it versatile when we have little room. A favorite setup is connecting it to a projector, making it a great mobiliity solution.
