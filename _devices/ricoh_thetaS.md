The Theta S from Ricoh is a camera that captures 360Â° stills and full HD movies with a single click. (B&H Photo)

##### Why this device?
The Theta S is one of the most affordable ways to create high quality 360 photos with one button press. We use it for timelapses and photos that can be viewed on your phone or virtual reality. We can easily document a space and annotate information on it later.
