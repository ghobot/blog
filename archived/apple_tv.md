Apple TV is a network appliance and entertainment device developed and sold by Apple Inc. that can receive digital data from a number of sources and stream it to a capable television. (Wikipedia)

##### Why this device?
With our mobility investment in Apple iPads in the hands of students, the current gen apple tv is a perfect compliment. It supports the ability to share your screen. Applications introduced to the platform can be controlled via an ios device. We have found it an invaluable tool in the Innovation Room for meetings and demonstrating how we are pushing the limits of the iPad in medical education.
